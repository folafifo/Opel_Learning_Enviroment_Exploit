SQL Course Introduction An To Databases Objectives This module defines what a database is and describes the central concepts of database It also explains benefits using technology compared to traditional file processing techniques Database logically coherent collection related data should provide A single source information for user groups multiple applications Independence from way actually stored in files on disk Concurrency Control so that concurrent applications or users operations will appear happen one after another ie no interference between operating data at same time Data integrity control controls type domain values relationships within security guards privacy uses set describe structure contained it These differ different types Model characterising which organised Database Management System DBMS programs enable create maintain DBMS general purpose software system enables define construct manipulate databases various usually supports particular model Therefore most management systems are described by model they support Hierarchical type represents as hierarchical tree structures Each hierarchy number records Although have query language these languages implementation not standardised Network record limited kind relationship The network also knows CODASYL DBTG Model has an associative recordatatime language must be embedded application programming eg COBOL Relational Tables Most relational DBMSs support high level called Structured Query Language Object Oriented objects contain both can process data standard yet been agreed but proposals standards already made agreement expected next few years were first designed allow share controlled manner control retrievals still major advantage databases However several other important summarised systems Isolation data By embedding storage retrieval application many may access information Denial Unauthorised Access held Representation complex datatypes among Enforcement constraints piece have Provide automatic backup recovery introduce basic notion Model Describe key theory this Modelling originally arose work done EF Codd IBM research laboratories idea organise all items into relations Informally each relation resembles table thus inserted modified deleted queriedbased
